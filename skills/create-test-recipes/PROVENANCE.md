New DevStack name and instructions; no content copied from the old installed
`create-verification-skill`. This is a separate staged skill, not an update to it.

Changes: project-pack/client-neutral discovery, maintenance in place, scoped
startup and synthetic data, per-recipe execution status, independent recipe
validity/application outcome, distinct PR/live release evidence, task-relevant
API/quality targets, and return to the existing repair flow. No dependency on a
second maintenance skill or scheduler, and no new deployment permissions.
