## Third-party material

| Path | Origin | License |
|---|---|---|
| `skills/create-test-recipes/` | Adapted from Lauren Tan (Poteto), pstack `create-verification-skill`, [`cursor/plugins` at `c49b37a2c0e7bede60a71ad7322e3f12c337a3da`](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/c49b37a2c0e7bede60a71ad7322e3f12c337a3da/pstack/skills/create-verification-skill) | MIT, notice retained in [`skills/create-test-recipes/LICENSE`](skills/create-test-recipes/LICENSE); see [`PROVENANCE.md`](skills/create-test-recipes/PROVENANCE.md) and [`source.json`](skills/create-test-recipes/source.json) |
| `skills/ponytail/` | Adapted from [Dietrich Gebert's Ponytail](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail) | MIT; upstream notice in [`LICENSE.txt`](skills/ponytail/LICENSE.txt) and origin in [`PROVENANCE.json`](skills/ponytail/PROVENANCE.json) |
| `skills/reverse-engineer-anything/` | Adapted from morluto's [REA](https://github.com/morluto/rea), `.agents/skills/reverse-engineer-anything` at [`17f704050f431c195ba2280aca162e698aea408a`](https://github.com/morluto/rea/tree/17f704050f431c195ba2280aca162e698aea408a/.agents/skills/reverse-engineer-anything). The six reference files are unchanged. `SKILL.md` adds a `tool_count` metadata line and pins `npx -y rea-agents@latest` to `@6.4.0`. | MIT; the upstream notice is reproduced [below](#rea-mit-license) |

## Design sources (read, not copied)

The Patstack workflow was designed after reading the projects listed in [`skills/patstack/references/sources.md`](skills/patstack/references/sources.md): Theo's tstack, Matt Pocock's skills, Poteto's pstack, Zeroshot's review loop and Ponytail. The adapted material listed above keeps its own license status; the remaining names and links acknowledge design sources, not endorsement. No blanket MIT license is applied to copied third-party material.
